/*! Evaluate the pattern with the given environment.

 *  A call of this method evaluate the pattern and calls the
 *  result handler for each match of the pattern with the information
 *  in the database.
 *
 *  vars - A dictionary with bound variables. The key is the
 *         primary key of the variable (as an TXLInteger), the value
 *         is the primary key of the term (as an TXLInteger).
 *
 *  ctxs - A list of TXLContext objects, which should be considered
 *         during the evaluation.
 *
 *  mos - A TXLMovingObjectSequence as a window restricting the temporal and
 *        spatial aspect of the evaluation. Only triple in the contexts
 *        which are valid in this moving object sequence can be used in the evaluation.
 *
 *  rev - The revision which should be used for the evaluation.
 *
 *  handler - The result handler is called for each match of the pattern.
 *  
 *  If the pattern in found at least once in the contexts, the method
 *  returns YES, otherwise NO.
